# Imbalance-Handling(using SMOTE)-and-Imgae-Classification

**Introduction**

In our digitalized age, mobile phones have become a necessity, with Android mobile phones accounting for the bulk of users. Mobile applications(apps) have simplified many parts of life, including entertainment, health tracking, and many more. With the benefits come the drawbacks; malicious and fraudulent apps are on the rise. In its latest newsletter Google has announced 1.2 million apps have been blocked by the firm, due to the applications harmful activities.

These considerations fuelled the development of machine learning methods for determining whether an app is harmful or not, which is the study's goal.

For this project, a dataset with permission details for many applications was used, and several pre-processing steps were performed, including data imbalance handling, categorical variable handling, and the different machine learning models for classifying the apps were developed.

Evaluating the models, the hyper parameter tuned Random Forest performed the best out of five different machine learning models, with an overall accuracy of 85.26 percent.

**Steps**

**Data Preprocessing**

> Handling Null values

> Variable selection

> Feature scaling

> One-hot encoding (Categorical variable handling)


**Classification Models**

> Random forest

> NaÃ¯ve Bayes

> Support vector machines - SVM

> K-Nearest Neighbours -KNN
